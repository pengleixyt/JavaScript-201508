I¡¯d never gone with the wind 
            Em 
Just let it flow 
       G            (A)          D 
Let it take me where it wants to go 
                  A                    Em 
Till you open the door there¡¯s so much more

               Em  
Made life your own 
      G           (A)          D 
Every sky was your own kind of blue 
                A                   Em 
And I wanted to know how that would feel 
        G 
And you made it so real
