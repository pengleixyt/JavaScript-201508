I've never gone with the wind.                   我从不会飘，
Just let it flow,let it take me                  让它流动，让它带我飘
Where it wants to go                             飘到想去的地方。
'Til you opened the door                         直到你打开大门，
There's so much more                             那有许多
I'd never seen it before                         我之前从来没有看过的。
I was trying to fly,but I couldn't find wings       我试着飞翔，但是我找不到（我的那双）翅膀
Then you came along and you changed everything      然后，你来了，你改变了一切

CHORUS

You lift my feet off the ground,spin me around        你使我的双脚离开了地面，使我旋转着 
You make me crazier,crazier                                    你让我感到疯狂，疯狂
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes        这感觉就像是我是属于你的，我迷上你了。
You make me crazier,crazier                                   你让我感到疯狂，疯狂

I watched from a distance as you                      我看着远处的你
Made life your own,every sky was                      让你拥有的生活，每一片天空都
Your own kind of blue                                    像你拥有的蓝色般
And I wanted to know                                            我想知道
How that would feel and you made it so real           怎么像你那般将感觉弄得如此真实 
You showed me something that I couldn't see         你告诉我那看不见的东西
You opened my eyes and you made me believe    你让我的双眼睁开，让我相信

CHORUS

Baby,you showed me what living is for                   宝贝，你让我知道生活是为了什么
I don't want to hide anymore                                   我不想再隐藏什么了 

CHORUS

Crazier , Crazier                                                     疯狂，疯狂…………
